# Project Description
This repository contains data and code from a study of the neurogenetics of autism spectrum disorder in the Freeman lab at Utah State University. This specific aspect of the project is examining the causes of differential oxytocin receptor (OXTR) binding density in the basal forebrains of autistics vs. allistics. The data being analyzed is data from fluorescent in-situ hybridization (fISH) in the ventral pallidum (VP) and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). This project has been funded by a combination of a Summer 2022 USU URCO grant and a Summer 2023 Peak Summer Research Fellowship, as well as funds from the Freeman lab.
